# Usage

Suppose you want to remove all artifacts older than N days from 'reponame'.
You should take the following steps:

1. Install `artifactory-cleanup`
2. Ð¡reate a python file, for example, `reponame.py` with the following contents:
```python
from artifactory_cleanup import rules
from artifactory_cleanup.rules import CleanupPolicy

RULES = [

    # ------ ALL REPOS --------
    CleanupPolicy(
       'Delete files older than 30 days',
        rules.repo('reponame'),
        rules.delete_older_than(days=30),
    ),
]
```
3. Run the command to SHOW (not remove) artifacts that will be deleted:
```bash
artifactory-cleanup --user user --password password --artifactory-server https://repo.example.com/artifactory --config reponame.py
```
4. Add `--destroy` flag to REMOVE artifacts
```bash
artifactory-cleanup --destroy --user user --password password --artifactory-server https://repo.example.com/artifactory --config reponame.py
```

## Commands ##

```bash
# Debug
# debug run - only print founded artifacts. it do not delete
artifactory-cleanup --user user --password password --artifactory-server https://repo.example.com/artifactory --config reponame.py

# Clean up empty folder
# --remove-empty-folder
# You need to use the plugin https://github.com/jfrog/artifactory-user-plugins/tree/master/cleanup/deleteEmptyDirs to delete empty folders
artifactory-cleanup --remove-empty-folder --user user --password password --artifactory-server https://repo.example.com/artifactory

# Debug run only for ruletestname. Find any *ruletestname*
# debug run - only print founded artifacts. it do not delete
artifactory-cleanup --rule-name ruletestname --user user --password password --artifactory-server https://repo.example.com/artifactory --config reponame.py

# REMOVE
# For remove artifacts use --destroy
artifactory-cleanup --destroy --user user --password password --artifactory-server https://repo.example.com/artifactory  --config reponame.py
```

## Available Rules ##

All rules are imported from the `rules` module.
See also [List of available cleaning rules](docs/RULES)

## Artifact cleanup policies ##

To add a cleaning policy you need:

- Create a python file, for example, `reponame.py`. `artifacroty-cleanup` imports the variable `RULES`, so you can make a python package.
- Add a cleanup rule from the [available cleanup rules](docs/RULES).

```python
from artifactory_cleanup import rules
from artifactory_cleanup.rules import CleanupPolicy

RULES = [

    CleanupPolicy(
       'Delete all * .tmp repositories older than 7 days',
        rules.repo_by_mask('*. tmp'),
        rules.delete_older_than(days = 7),
    ),
    CleanupPolicy(
        'Delete all images older than 30 days from docker-registry exclude latest, release',
        rules.repo('docker-registry'),
        rules.exclude_docker_images(['*:latest', '*:release*']),
        rules.delete_docker_images_not_used(days=30),
    ),
]
```

## Container Usage ##

Place custom self-signed certs for internal Artifactory instances in `container/certificates/` folder.  

```bash
    docker build --build-arg VERSION=0.3 . --tag artifactory-cleanup:latest
```

Upload the image to your container registry.  

```bash
    docker run \
    --mount type=bind,source=./rules.py,target=/tmp/rules.py \
    -e ARTIFACTORY_USER=<username> \
    -e ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD=<password> \
    -e ARTIFACTORY_URL=<artifactory url> \
    -e ARTIFACTORY_RULES_CONFIG=/tmp/rules.py \
    <registry>/artifactory-cleanup:latest
```

## Helm Chart Usage ##

Make sure you have helm installed -> link!  
Put your rules.py into the helm chart folder (besides `Chart.yaml`). -> link existing docs  
Prepare a `answer.yaml` file to overwrite values in `values.yaml`.  
On your terminal, navigate to the helm chart folder and install the chart using the following command:  

```bash
    helm upgrade -i <release name> . -n <namespace> -f answer.yaml
    # e.g.: helm upgrade -i artifactory-cleanup . -n artifactory-cleanup -f answer.yaml
```
